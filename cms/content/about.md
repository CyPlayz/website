Hi! I'm Michael. I'm 18, I'm a tech nerd, and I've been a software developer for around 5 years. I spend most of my free time writing various software using Go, Node.js, Java, and a handful of other languages I'm learning on the side, including C and C++. I'm quite interested in learning about how technology works internally, such as hardware, operating systems, the internet, etc. I'm also interested in applied security and cryptography, and methods to maintain your privacy and anonymity online.

I'm a former Taekwondo sport competitor, and I've competed in many tournaments ranging from local to national. I've trained at two different dojangs over the course of 14 years, and I'm proud to say I've reached the rank of 4th Dan (4th Degree Black Belt), awarded by the Kukkiwon. I've been able to make many lasting friends along the way, both during training and competing, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.

I'm active on GitHub, and you can contact me via my Discord server or via other means if you'd like to see what I'm working on, ask for help, or just say hi!

I'm thinking about publishing Node.js or Go tutorials on YouTube in the future, so if you're interested, let me know! It'd be nice to hear there's an interested audience. I'm also open to providing 1-on-1 help with programming or other topics based on the things I've learned, so just reach out if you need help with anything
