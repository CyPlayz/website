Hello there!

My name is <b><i><u>Cylis</b></i></u>, but you can call me <b><i><u>Cy</b></i></u>! I’m currently a full-time student pursuing a degree in Computer Information Technology (CIT). Alongside college, I work part-time in IT and write small programs and applications in JavaScript, Node.js, and Python. I'm also currently trying to learn C and C#.

Feel free to get in contact with me below if you’d like to talk about anything about anything!
