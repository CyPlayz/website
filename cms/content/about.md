Hey there, my name is Cylis, or just Cy. I'm a tech nerd, a CIT student, and software developer. I've been contributing on small projects and playing with hardware for almost an decade now. I spend most of my free time playing video games or trying to learn more languages like C, Go, C++, and Node.js.
