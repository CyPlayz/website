Hey there, my name is Cylis, or just Cy. I'm a tech nerd, a IT student, and software developer. I've been contributing on small projects and playing with hardware for almost 9 years now. I spend most of my free time playing video games or trying to learn more languages like C, Go, C++, and Node.js. I'm currently also looking into taking a B.S. in Computer Engineering.
